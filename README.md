#Football_Player_Team_Detection_and_Tactical_Data_Analytics

This project focuses on advanced football analytics, including team detection, tactical map visualization, and ball possession analysis. The primary goal is to process video frames, detect players, identify their teams based on color palettes, and visualize tactical maps for deeper insights into the game.

#This project involves the following key components:

Team Detection: Identifying players on the field and classifying them into their respective teams based on jersey colors.

Tactical Map Visualization: Creating and aligning tactical maps to visualize player positions and movements during the game.

Ball Possession Analysis: Analyzing which team has possession of the ball at any given moment.
Features

YOLOv8 for Object Detection: Utilized for detecting players and the ball in video frames.

Homographic Transformation: Applied for aligning the field and tactical maps with real-time player positions.

Color Palette Matching: Used to identify and differentiate teams based on the color of their jerseys.

Tactical Maps: Visualize player positions and movements on a 2D tactical map, providing insights into team formations and strategies.

Ball Possession Analysis: Determine ball possession and analyze team performance over the course of the game.



#Technologies Used

Python

YOLOv8: Object detection model for identifying players and the ball.

OpenCV: Image processing and homographic transformations.

Numpy: Numerical computations for data analysis.

Matplotlib: Visualization of tactical maps and results.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning models for additional analysis (if applicable).
